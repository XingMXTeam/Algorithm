## Summary

### Data Structure

One to One(linear)

Data Structure | Features |  Mark
---- | ---- | ---
Array | random get or set operations; O(1); fast based on CPU Cache | 
LinkedList | insert、delete、add's time complex: O(1) | 
SkipList | promoted LinkedList; insert、delete、add's time complex: O(logn) | 
Stack | first in last out | 
Queue | first in first out | 
Heap | one priority queue; get max or min value in O(logn) | 
HashMap | promoted array; features like array | key is not used directly; hash value which generated by hash function

One to More

Data Structure | Features |  Mark
---- | ---- | ---
Tree | like LinkedList | 
BinarySearchTree、BinarySortTree(because level traverse can output ordered sequences)| any nodes's value in left tree is less than or equal to right | 
AVL(BinaryBalancedTree) | one special BinarySearchTree: height diff between left and right tree less 1 |

### Algorithm

+ Recursive: problems can be solved by sub problems, can write clean code.

+ Greedy

+ Dynamic Problem

+ Sort

+ Backtracking

### Time Complex and Space Complex

Space Complex means extra memory space used.

### Problem Category

+ String Problem

+ Sort Problem 

+ Array PrefixSum-SubArray Problem

+ LinkedList Operations' Problem

+ Backtracking subset and arrangement Problems

+ Knapsack Problem
